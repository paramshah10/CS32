# CS 32 - Data Structures and Algorithms

These are my solutions for the four projects and five homeworks from UCLA CS 32 Spring 2019 with Prof Smallberg. These are my own solutions and are therefore not perfect. The source code for the various projects should only be used as a vague guideline to help you if you are stuck. Do not copy directly from these files as they will result in your own penalisation!
